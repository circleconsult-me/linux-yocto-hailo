DesignWare I2S controller

Required properties:
 - compatible : Must be "snps,designware-i2s" or "hailo15,designware-i2s"
 - reg : Must contain the I2S core's registers location and length
 - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the controller's
   clocks. The controller expects one clock: the clock used as the sampling
   rate reference clock sample.
 - clock-names : "i2sclk" for the sample rate reference clock.
 - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the DMA channels that are used by
   the core. The core expects one or two dma channels: one for transmit and
   one for receive.
 - dma-names : "tx" for the transmit channel, "rx" for the receive channel.

Required properties for hailo15,designware-i2s only:
 - rx-sample-pace : recording fix samples offsets pattern
 - rx-sample-cmp-to : comparison options for samples paces pattern synchronization:
   expected pattern samples value to sync:
   * "zero" : Compare current sample to zero.
   * "prev-val" : Compare current sample to the previous sample.
 - tx-sample-offset : playback start samples pattern fixes starting from sample <xxx>.
 - tx-sample-pace: playback fix samples offsets pattern.
 - rx-sample-pace-pattern-repetitions: number of consecutive pattern repetitions required for recording synchronization.

Optional properties:
 - interrupts: The interrupt line number for the I2S controller. Add this
   parameter if the I2S controller that you are using does not support DMA.
